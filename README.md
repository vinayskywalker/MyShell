# System-Practicum-Assignment


Programming Language Used: C++14\
How to Run the program:\
``` g++ my_prog.cpp ```\
(this command will generate an executable file i.e. a.out).\
To test the 11th part :-  ``` ./a.out batchfile ``` \(where ./a.out is executable file and batchfile contains a set of commands.\
To test the remaining part:-  ./a.out.

Module used - \
<stdlib.h>  -  The stdlib.h header defines four variable types, several macros, and various functions for performing general functions.\
<stdio.h> -    The stdio.h header defines three variable types, several macros, and various functions for performing input and output.\
<string.h> - The string.h header defines one variable type, one macro, and various functions for manipulating arrays of characters.\
<unistd> -  chdir() function is defined in <unistd>\
<dirent.h> - The <dirent.h> header shall define the following type\
 DIR     A type representing a directory stream.\
The DIR type may be an incomplete type.\
       It shall also define the structure dirent which shall include the  following members:\
 ``` ino_t  d_ino       File serial number.```\
``` char   d_name[]    Filename string of entry. ```\


<iostream> - Header that defines the standard input/output stream objects.\
<vector>  -   Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted\
<list>  - Lists are sequence containers that allow non-contiguous memory allocation\
